    "## Haskell is the Best Available Language for Writing \"Boring Line of Business\" Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a suprising claim for people that have looked into Haskell previously.  Based on it's reputation as a weird academic language you might expect to hear the opposite -- that it excels in certain esoteric or specialized (maybe \"mathy\") domains but not so much for \"practical\" situations like building a CRUD web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will say that Haskell isn't all sunshine and roses.  I think the biggest problem is that Haskell seems to strange and scary to experienced programmers coming from other languages.  If you are already familiar with Java and you decide to learn python not only do a lot of the concept translate pretty directly but the areas where they differ allow you to easily compare them and evaluate the tradeoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encountering Haskell is more like the type of situation that arises in sci-fi movies where the heroes encounter aliens that have strange (usually green) alien-technology versions of all of the familiar weapons and tools they are used to.  Inevitabiy the alien weapons have more fire power than the human versions -- eg. they are energy weapons instead of bullets driven by gun powder, they are indestructible, they have limitless power sources, and so on.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Maybe the first time a human tries to use one of the alien guns they get shocked or they blow a huge hole in the wall or have some other experience that frightens them away from trying to use the alien tech for their own purposes.  In the movies though there's usually some otherwise hopeless situation that forces the humans to resort to harnessing the superior alien technology to save the themselves or more likely the entire planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's relatively rare to encounter such dire circumstances in the world of programming languages, so the unfortunate reality is that most developers coming from other languages tend to be gunshy and reluctant to press on after their initial encounter with Haskell.  The good news is that unlike literal alien technology, while the people that have created Haskell and related technology might *seem* like aliens to us, they're really just super nerdy humans -- which means a) if they can understand it so can we, and b) they're actually around, available to help us and usually friendly to our cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "This inability for experienced developers from other languages to easily get up to speed leads to a much smaller community than other mainstream languages, and the smaller community leads to a whole host of knock-on effects around eg. tooling, learning resources, opportunities for learning on the job, inability to ramp up large teams quickly, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook will be my attempt to justify and clarify my headline claim above and maybe convince you that like crazy high-tech alien energy weapons, Haskell affords us such a high degree of increas leverage that these disadvantages are easily outweighed by the advantages in the long run (even if we're \"just\" building CRUD web apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully if you're reading (or hearing) this you've already been through my Taste of Haskell introductory material and you came away with the understanding that quite a lot can be accomplished in Haskell using tools that are similar to those that you are familiar with from other languages.  In the sections that follow I hope to elaborate on some of the differences and what benefits those differences bring to the experience of developing software in order to justify the effort required to understand their strangeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately I think the only sure way to really grok what I'm trying to communicate is to dive in and get over the hurdle of the strangeness and get to the point where you start to experience the benefits first hand -- so I will consider it to be a success if I convince you that such a journey might be worth embarking on.\n",

    "\n",
    "Any good Haskell module/blog post/notebook begins with a raft of language pragmas (which enable various extensions to the core language) and import statements.  As a quick aside, these language pragmas are often one of the things that seem to put people off the language a bit.  I see a lot of posts even from people that like Haskell complaining that dealing with the pragmas/extensions is one of the worst parts of Haskell.  I really don't understand what the big deal here is.  In practice you don't have to worry about language extensions until you want to do something that requires them, then while learning that thing you will learn about the extension you need and you'll put in your project (either at the top of the file or in your .cabal file) and you're good to go.  There are a few language extensions that are contentious for various reasons but for the most part no one uses them and you don't have worry about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the warts of Haskell is that the default Prelude (think \"standard library\") includes a number of partial functions.  This basically means pure functions that can fail to return an answer of expected type for one reason or another (usually throw an exception or loop forever).  It's possible to write Haskell using the default Prelude and just avoid these through conscientiousness but it's a lot easier to just switch out the Prelude for one that replaces these functions with total versions.  Protolude is one such alternative Prelude and it doesn't make any controversial choices so it's a good choice for those starting out or for basing your own custom Prelude on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll add additional pragmas and imports throughout the document so there's at least some opportunity to understand what they are doing."

    "One of the defining charateristics of (well written) Haskell code is that it is succinct or terse.  People tend to use the word terse but I find that that terseness often has a bit of negative connotation attached -- as it the code is \"too terse\" or \"terse code is hard to read\".  I think \"succinctness\" is a better term and conveys more clearly that our ultimate goal is clarity.  It's easy to imagine (and write!) code that is too terse but hard to imagine code that is \"too succinct\" or \"too clear\".\n",

    "The difference is even more pronounced instead of just reading the code casually you are reading it in a situation like a code review or because you are trying to track down a bug.  In the Java code you have to start checking whether the bounds of the array are declared properly, whether each part of the loop declaration is correct, and so forth and so on.  In the Haskell code you got most of that in the same first glance.  There's just far less room for bugs to hide.\n",

    "It's worth noting here that in modern Java you can probably write something much closer to the Haskell code, perhaps something like this:\n",

    "It may be possible write this even more succinctly in Java but this is about the best I could do having been free of Java for more than a decade.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see not only is it still considerably more cumbersome than the equivalent Haskell code but it's not even really equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the Haskell code the initial list from 2-100 is generated once, and then \"drop 5\" version just uses the fifth element as the head of a new list.  The 'b' list is entirely shared with the same range from the 'a' list.\n",
    "- There's also not this conversion to/from Arrays.  The conversion toArray at the end is not only necessary to print it out but also because IntStreams can only be consumed once in Java.  Then we have to convert back to a stream to do the filtering to produce the 'b' list.  Then we have to convert back to an array to print them out... using an awkward `Arrays.toString` helper which adds another wart.  \n",
    "- On top of that there's no built in \"drop\" method for streams so I had to resort to the \"filter\" hack which doesn't scale as I had to stop and do the math to figure out which the fifth value would be -- which works in this trivial example but wouldn't if the calculation were any more complex.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the extraneous noise here is in service of communicating to the Java compiler how to do what you want to do, whereas the Haskell version reads like a description of the result you want with little to no information about how it should be accomplished.  Hopefully this benefit is obvious even in small samples of code like this but the ability to focus on expressing the business goal rather than constructing a machine to accomplish the business goal becomes really valuable as you scale to larger and larger amounts of code.\n",

If you are debugging a function (perhaps not written by you) in a language with pervasive side effects then you might end up having to trace through every function call that it makes to find where some problem is occuring.  But in a pure function you can see that the only result of the function is the value returned.  \n",

    "## Property-based Testing with QuickCheck\n",
    "\n",
    "Property based testing exists at a point in between manual unit/UAT tests and proofs both on the spectrum of the value it provides and the effort that is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "With manual testing the programmer thinks about ways in which the code under test might break and then implements individual tests to check each of the possible failure modes they can think of.  This usually involves thinking about boundary conditions -- if a number is accepted as input: what happens if it's negative? zero? very large? etc.  If it's a string what happens if it is empty? if it contains unicode? if it's very large? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several problems with this approach.  The first is it only proves the specific cases that tests are written for don't occur -- it says nothing about the entire rest of the space of possibilities.  Secondly it is labor intensive as the more things you want to test the more tests you have to write.  Thirdly the tests are written by humans which can make mistakes in test code just as easily as they can in the code under test.  What's the solution to this? Do we need to write tests for our tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the opposite end of the spectrum is formal verification of programs via proofs.  Proofs solve the first problem -- a valid proof proves that a program (or function, etc) works correctly for all possible inputs.  They are still very labor intensive, but they scale better -- the programmer doesn't have to create a bigger proof to get more certainty.  One the third point proofs done by hand would suffer the same problem as unit tests -- human fallibility -- but no one does formal verification by hand.  For a long time (at least as I understand it) most systems for formal verification such as [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) were very difficult to work with and using proofs as a means of guaranteeing properties of practical programs was not considered feasible by many.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days the situation has improved with languages like Idris and Agda that blur the line between language and proof systems, but in the meantime property testing strikes a good balance in that they can be used effectively today in Haskell (and other languages) but they provide a level of confidence that, while less than that provided by formal proofs, is much greater than that provided by hand written tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is that you essentially provide a predicate which describes the property you expect to hold and the property testing library (in our case [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck)) generates a bunch of random inputs and tries them all, checking that the predicate holds.  QuickCheck uses some heuristics to try to do the same sort of things that a human developer would -- testing boundary conditions and so forth.\n",

    "## How to Get Started with Haskell\n",
    "\n",
    "If I've managed to pique your curiosity enough that you want to try Haskell out, one of the first issues you will run into is whether to use `cabal (new-build)` or `stack`.  Cabal is the perennial build/package management tool for Haskell.  For a long time it was so bad that the experience of using it often resulted in what came to be known as \"cabal hell\" and you can still find many references to how to escape from cabal hell in Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, Michael Snoyman created [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) which solved the vast majority of problems associated with cabal hell in one fell swoop.  Snoyman is a bit of controversial figure in the community and this (finally) led to great enough dissatisfaction on the behalf of the cabal developers that they created [\"cabal new-build\"](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/nix-local-build-overview.html) to attempt to address the problems in their own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I understand it these days it's roughly on parity with Stack's features though as a happy Stack user I haven't used it enough to be comfortable with it.  There's also a third option these days, which is using [the nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/).  The nix package manager was created for NixOS but can be used on any other unix operating system including OS X.  I am not sure about the level of support for windows. Nix, like haskell, has a fairly rough learning curve but I'm told that, like haskell, it is worth it -- but I haven't used it enough to testify to that point myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond using Stack you'll have to deal with getting editor integration working.  There are at least three good options for Emacs: [Haskell Mode](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode), [Intero](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero) (no s) and [dante](https://github.com/jyp/dante).  I happen to use haskell-mode but that's largely just historical happenstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There seem to be plenty of Vim users seem to are happy with their Haskell setups but I have no knowledge of the Vim related tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two good options for getting started quickly if you don't have a strong Editor/IDE preference -- the first is just to use whatever editor you want (probably with at least Haskell syntax highlighting installed) and then use [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid) as [described here](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/05/19/ghcid_for_the_win.html).  Ghcid is lightweight, \"just works\" with any other tooling and should work on any platform.  The second is to use [VSCode with Haskelly](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2017/06/08/learning-haskell-and-using-vscode-and-haskelly/) which gives you a fairly typical featureful IDE setup.\n",
